# Purposes
We have decided to open a small cafe in Los Angeles. Our cafe can be said to be quite unique, because we "employ" robots as waiters or waitresses. This project is promising, but requires large capital.

Therefore, together with our partners, we decided to attract investors. They are interested in the current state of the market—but can we sustain our success when the appeal of robots starts to wane?

Considering that we are an analytical expert, partners also ask us to prepare some market research. We have open source data about restaurants in LA.

# Libraries
*pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, warnings*
